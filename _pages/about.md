`I am currently on the academic job market and seek full-time positions with start dates in Fall 2024.`

As a researcher I am interested in data-driven modeling of soft materials, micromechanical modeling and the finite element method. So far in my PhD I have been focusing on integrating `physics` into `machine learning` methods as hard constraints. This ensures the models we develop are physically realistic, enhances extrapolation capabilities of the models and aids in convergence of numerical algorithms.
