PhD candidate at <a href='http://www.purdue.edu'>Purdue University</a> working under <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/OME/Areas/ptProfile?resource_id=132124&group_id=11989'>Dr. Adrian Buganza Tepole</a>. 

My research focuses on integrating `physics` into `machine learning` models as hard constraints. In my PhD, I developed machine learning models of material behaviors like hyperelasticity, viscoelasticity and damage using machine learning methods in a way that the underlying physics is <i>always</i> satisfied. Recently, I used `diffusion`, a mathematical model used in Generative AI, to construct a generative framework for physics-informed hyperelasticity.

I am a <a href='https://cee.duke.edu/about/awards-honors/melosh-medal'>Melosh medalist</a> and I have won a number of other recognitions during my PhD.
