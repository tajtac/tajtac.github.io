PhD candidate at <a href='http://www.purdue.edu'>Purdue University</a> working on applying <b> machine learning </b> methods to <b>mechanics of soft materials</b>. I am co-advised by <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/OME/Areas/ptProfile?resource_id=132124&group_id=11989'>Dr. Adrian Buganza Tepole</a> and <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=113500'>Dr. Ilias Bilionis</a>.

As a researcher I am interested in data-driven modeling of soft materials, micromechanical modeling and the finite element method. So far in my PhD I have been focusing on integrating `physics` into `machine learning` methods as hard constraints. This ensures the models we develop are physically realistic, enhances extrapolation capabilities of the models and aids in convergence of numerical algorithms.
