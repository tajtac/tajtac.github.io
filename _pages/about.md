I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Bioengineering at Stanford University, focusing on understanding the biomechanics of the human brain using machine learning. Previously, I completed my PhD at Purdue University.

My research focuses on integrating `physics` into `machine learning` models as hard constraints. In my PhD, I developed machine learning models of material behaviors like hyperelasticity, viscoelasticity and damage using machine learning methods in a way that the underlying physics is <i>always</i> satisfied. Recently, I used `diffusion`, a mathematical model used in Generative AI, to construct a generative framework for physics-informed hyperelasticity.
