I am a senior PhD student co-advised by [Dr. Adrian Buganza Tepole](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/OME/Areas/ptProfile?resource_id=132124&group_id=11989) and [Dr. Ilias Bilionis](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=113500) at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu).

As a researcher I am interested in data-driven modeling of soft materials, micromechanical modeling and the finite element method. So far in my PhD I have been focusing on integrating `physics` into `machine learning` methods as hard constraints. This ensures the models we develop are physically realistic, enhances extrapolation capabilities of the models and aids in convergence of numerical algorithms.

Previously I obtained my master's from [METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) and worked in [Turkish Aerospace Industries](https://www.tusas.com/en) as an engineer.

In my spare time I like to draw and go on hikes with my amazing wife. I speak Turkmen (native), Persian (native), Turkish (native) and Russian (Intermediate) in addition to English.
