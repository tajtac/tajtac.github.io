      description:
        - Developed a model of hyperelastic material behavior based on feed-forward neural networks in Python/TensorFlow.
        - Used special properties of Neural ODEs to develop a model of hyperelasticity where physics-based constraints are satisfied a priori using Python/JAX. This approach circumvents the use of a complicated loss function thus avoiding a large number of unnecessary floating-point operations.
        - Developed the first physics-informed data-driven model of finite viscoelasticity in the world. The project uses Neural ODEs to model viscoelasticity in such a way that the relevant physical laws are satisfied automatically.
        - Currently working on a hierarchical Bayesian model of hyperelasticity using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) in Python/Numpyro. The model can characterize the uncertainty in training data and transfer knowledge from the population to an individual.
