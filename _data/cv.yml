    - title: Postdoctoral Scholar
      institution: Stanford University, CA, USA
      year: 2024 - Now
      description:
        - Using experiments, finite element modeling, and machine learning to expand our understanding of the biomechanics of concussion

    - title: Research Assistant
      institution: Purdue University, IN, USA
      year: 2021 - 2024
      description:
        - Developed a model of hyperelastic material behavior based on feed-forward neural networks in Python/TensorFlow.
        - Used special properties of Neural ODEs to develop a model of hyperelasticity where physics-based constraints are satisfied a priori using Python/JAX. This approach circumvents the use of a complicated loss function thus avoiding a large number of unnecessary floating-point operations.
        - Developed the first fully data-driven, physics-informed model of finite viscoelasticity. The model uses Neural ODEs to model viscoelasticity in such a way that the relevant physical laws are satisfied automatically.
