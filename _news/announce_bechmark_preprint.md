Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10714">collaborative work</a> with Prof. Ellen Kuhl's lab in Stanford University is out on arXiv. In this paper we compare and benchmark three data-driven approaches used in modeling hyperelastic behavior: Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks, Input Convex Neural Networks and Neural ODEs.
