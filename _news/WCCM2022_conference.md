I presented my work on Developing Data-Driven Models of Anisotropic Hyperelasticity with Neural ODEs at the <a href="https://www.wccm2022.org">World Congress on Computational Mechanics 2022</a>. The conference was in fully virtual format and presenters uploaded recorded presentations. My presentation video can be watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tblSfNW1qhM">here</a>.
